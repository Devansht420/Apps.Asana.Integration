<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
### Why we need Asana Integration?

Integrating Asana with RocketChat brings significant advantages for its community, particularly for teams coordinating project work. One notable benefit is the streamlined workflow and enhanced task awareness it offers. With the Asana integration, users receive relevant notifications about task updates, assignments, or comments directly within their Rocket.Chat channels. This not only minimizes the disruption of constantly switching applications but also fosters better alignment and quicker responses to project developments right within the team's primary communication space.
